## **BREAFLY ABOUT ME**
I have been working as a SOC Analyst for a year now. During this time I became experienced in protecting client assets, writing correlations rules, setting up a SIEM system. However, I am particularly interested in becoming a web developer. For this, I am gaining knowledge through various learning courses. I believe that my work experience, diligence and obtained skills in web development will help me to succeed in becoming a web developer.
